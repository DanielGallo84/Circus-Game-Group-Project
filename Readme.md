# WELCOME TO THE CIRCUS GAME!

Our clients, Mr. Giacomo and Maria, have asked us to create a game for both mobile and computer (divided into three pages) with the theme 'Circus'. 

This game consists of a start form, where we will enter the different names of the participants and a random avatar for each one. All these names must be modifiable and removable in the list itself. 

Through this, the game will be created where all of them will be represented on screen with their respective name and avatar. By pressing the start button, the sacrifices will begin at the hands of our well-known friend Sideshow Bob. The players will be randomly eliminated one by one until only one of them manages to survive.

Once the game is over, we will be able to access the list of results where the names will be reflected by rounds with their avatars in order of elimination, the last one being the first eliminated and the first one the only survivor. 

Also, as an addition, at the bottom of the game page, we have 3 additional buttons. One to return to the page to enter participants, another to start the game again and the last one to reset the data completely.
